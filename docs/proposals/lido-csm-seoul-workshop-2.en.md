# Proposal: Lido CSM Workshop 2 in Seoul

## Abstract

- **Expected Date:** Feb 21 or Feb 28, 2026
  - Scheduled for after the Lunar New Year holiday in South Korea.

- **Expected Location:** [DSRV](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VT56iiRG8bwZuGao8)
  - I'm not sure, I've heard one of DSRV developers, he said we can rent the room for this hosting. It'll be free.

- **Expected Amount of people:** Over 30 to 40
  - In the last time, the event collected about 20~30 people. I got some needs from Korean University Study Group. some of students, they want to learn how to run a node to get a job and to join the company. But, It's very hard to get experiences as a intern or similar way to do it. So that, I want to use this event for that.

- **Expected price:** $300 ~ $500
  - I'm not sure. Last time, we prepared a small snack and drink (hand-made hamburger & soda). It was about 15,000~20,000 KRW ($10.3 ~ $13.7). So, I expanded to about that amount for considering additional audiences.

## Purpose

1. Re-introduction of Lido CSM
2. Increase Ethereum Home Staker in South Korea for getting decentralized network.
3. Trial to make a local community for rescuing node when someone got something wrong. (Like Rocket Pool Rescue Node)
4. Education for Korean students who want to know running a node.

## Details

I want to re-introduce and expand Lido CSM operators in Seoul as well for getting decetralized in the Ethereum Network.

However, currently Lido CSM operators is quite not famouse here. So, I think it's good time to introduce this system for public in South Korea.

1. I'll prepare Lido CSM PPT for speaking
2. I'll contact to DSRV to host places and to support deep-tech things like Ethereum Consensus Logic sttuf to understand how to avoid slashing and how to keep good performance.
3. I'll collect people who have joined into Lido CSM & Lido CSM ICS validator to share our experiencs during on-boarding into it.
4. I'll try to make a local community rescue system and introduce [my open-source setup](https://github.com/jeongseup/lido-csm-node-operator).
